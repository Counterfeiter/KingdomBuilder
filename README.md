# Kingdom Builder Console Board Game

Python implementation of the Kingdom Builder rules and game play

## Getting Started

This little python scripts could be used to play a kindom builder game with the command line interface.
Because this is a pain, it would be great to have a browser based (js) frontend.

### Why?

This is the first step to start an AI challenge.
gym wrapper is follwing in the upcomming commits.

### Prerequisites

Pure python 3

#### Execution speed

If you train an AI engine the game engine is maybe the bottleneck. 
Because of the pure python concept, there is no speed improve with numpy. Maybe I will drop this concept later.

Speed could be improved:
1. rework the code and stay pure python
2. switch to numpy
3. track only changes (place, move settlement) and stop rebuilding the lists

### Installing

Clone and play around
